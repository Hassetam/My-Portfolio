        <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
        <p> 
            In my free time, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me engaged and inspired. Some of my <strong>hobbies</strong> include:
        </p> 
        <ul> <!-- unordered list with bullet points -->
            <li>Spending quality time with people</li>
            <li>Watching movies</li>
            <li>Traveling to new places and exploring</li> 
            <li>Experimenting with cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Movies, in particular, have shown me the extent of what technology can do and inspired me to explore new possibilities. I believe one of the most exciting aspects of technology is that the skills Iâ€™m developing in web development and IT are versatile, valuable, and applicable in many areas, no matter where my interests or career path take me.
