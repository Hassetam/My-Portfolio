        <div>Hello! My name is Hasset Adugna, and I am a passionate student currently learning front-end web development. </div> 
  <br><div>This marks the beginning of my journey into the world of coding and design. 
  This is my very first website, created as a personal portfolio to showcase my growth, skills, and the projects I build along the way. 
  The site is developed using only HTML, making it a foundational step in strengthening my understanding of web structure and layout. 
  I am excited to continue improving my abilities and exploring more advanced technologies in the future.</div>
